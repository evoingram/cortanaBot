# Telemetry Analytics

Bot Analytics provides telemetry for analyzing conversation activities.

## Requirements

To enable bot analytics: 

* [Add Telemetry](https://aka.ms/AddBotTelemetry) via Application Insights in the Bot Code
* [Enable Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-resources-app-insights-keys?view=azure-bot-service-4.0) on Azure Bot Service

Once active, basic visualization is available out of the box on Azure Bot Service. In addition, one can deploy and customize more advanced analytics views. 

## Conversation Health Dashboard

The Conversation Health Dashboard template presents analytics view of bot conversation activity.
