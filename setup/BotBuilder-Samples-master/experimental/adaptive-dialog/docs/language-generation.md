# Language generation

Adaptive dialogs natively support and work with the new Language Generation system. 

See [here][1] to learn more about Language Generation preview.

Once you have authored your .lg files for your Adaptive dialogs (or your bot project), you can simply register as middleware and use  `ILanguageGenerator` and `IMessageActivityGenerator` for full-blown generation support (including template resolution) anywhere in your bot.

All [sample projects][2] follow the exact same pattern.

In any Adaptive Dialog
```C#
string[] paths = { ".", "Dialogs", "RootDialog", "RootDialog.lg" };
string fullPath = Path.Combine(paths);
var adaptiveDialog = new AdaptiveDialog(nameof(AdaptiveDialog))
{ 
    Generator = new TemplateEngineLanguageGenerator(Templates.ParseFile(fullPath)),
    Triggers = new List<OnCondition> () {
        // Triggers
    }    
}
```

With this, you can simply refer to a LG template anywhere in your bot's response. 

``` C#
new SendActivity("${MyLGTemplateName()}")
```

**Note:** By default, your bot's entire state is passed to the LG sub-system for resolution. So your teamplates can refer all properties that are available in memory just the way your code does.

``` markdown
# EchoTemplate
> The reference to {turn.Activity.Text} is valid in the LG template because bot state is passed in on all template evaluation calls.
- ${EchoPrefix()}, "${turn.Activity.Text}"

# EchoPrefix
- I heard you say
- You said
- Roger
```
