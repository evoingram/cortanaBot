### Overview of the Experimental Folder

The samples within this folder contain **experimental** work.  These samples are meant to provide a way to solicit
feedback on a given design, approach, or technology being considered by the Bot Framework Team.

The samples in this folder **should not** be used in a production environment.  They are not supported and the team is not implying a given approach used in these samples will be integrated into a future version of the Bot Framework SDK.  Instead, we want to provide a way to engage on topics that can help guide our roadmap for future work.

## Goals of this work

The Bot Framework Team is seeking feedback on a specific problem and possible solutions that exists when developing bots using the Bot Framework SDK.

Each sample contains a reference to the backing GitHub issue(s) that frames the problem and a bit about the approach.  Feedback on the sample should be added to the issue used to track the sample.


## Resources

The samples found in this folder are experimental, do not necessarily relate to one another, are stand-alone, and are not meant to be viewed in any particular order.  None of the samples in the **experimental** folder should be used with bots running in a production environment.

Experimental samples written in C# may have dependencies on assemblies pushed on the team's daily build feed.  To understand how to use assemblies from the daily build feed refer to [Using MyGet to consume daily builds](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-dotnet/blob/master/UsingMyGet.md) for further instructions.



## Experimental samples list

Experimental samples are organized per platform.
