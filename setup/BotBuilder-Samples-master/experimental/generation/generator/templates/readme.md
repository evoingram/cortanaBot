# Standard Templates

The tool includes a standard set of templates described below.
They can be extended or overridden by your own templates.
Current functionality includes:

- Generating .lg, .lu and .dialog files that robustly handle out of order and
  multiple responses for simple and array properties.
- Add, remove, clear and show for properties.
- Support for choosing between ambiguous entity values and entity property mappings.
- Recognizing and mapping all LUIS prebuilt entities.
- Help including auto-help on multiple retries.
- Cancel
- Confirmation

See the complete [dialog generation documentation](https://github.com/microsoft/BotBuilder-Samples/tree/master/experimental/generation/generator) for more information.

## Organization

Each possible JSON Schema type has a root template file, like [string.lg](string.lg) or [enum.lg](enum.lg) which defines the default `# entities` and `# templates` for that type.
The templates make use of a generation time library [generator.lg](generator.lg) which defines template commands that are useful when writing generation templates.
In the template descriptions below, italics are place holders that are defined by entity or property types.
Templates provide a lot of flexibility so the patterns below might have additional templates.

Most property types have template files for:

- `$type$-missing.dialog.lg` -- Ask for a missing property of $type$.
- `$type$-clear.dialog.lg` -- Clear a property of $type$.
- `$type$-show.dialog.lg` -- Show a property of $type$.
- `$type$Property.lg.lg` -- Define the .lg resources to name, ask for and show a property of $type$.

There are also template files for the entities that are defined in a `# entities` template, or a schema `$entities`.  
For each entity there is usually:

- `$entity$Entity.lg.lg` -- Define the .lg resources for showing an `$entity$` value.
- `$entity$Entity.lu.lg` -- Define the .lu resources need for recognizing an `$entity$` value and its property.
- `$entity$Entity-$type$.lg` -- Define the templates needed for mapping `$entity$` to a property of $type$.
- `$entity$Entity-add-$type$.dialog.lg` -- Define how to add an `$entity$` to a property of $type$.
- `$entity$Entity-remove-$type$.dialog.lg` -- Define how to remove an `$entity$` from a property of `$type$`.

In addition to property and entity templates there are also schema files like [standard.schema](standard.schema) or [age.schema](age.schema) that can be explicitly included into your schema in order to bring in more advanced functionality.

The standard templates extend the naming conventions to add `-$operation$` to the end of files to reflect a particular built-in operation.
