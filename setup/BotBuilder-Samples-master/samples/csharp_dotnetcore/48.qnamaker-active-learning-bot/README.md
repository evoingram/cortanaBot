# Active learning in QnA Maker
This sample shows how to integrate Active Learning in a QnA Maker bot with ASP.Net Core-2. Click [here][al#1] to know more about how to enable and use active learning .


## Concepts introduced in this sample
The [QnA Maker Service][7] enables you to build, train and publish a simple question and answer bot based on FAQ URLs, structured documents or editorial content in minutes.
In this sample, we demonstrate how to use the Active Learning to generate suggestions for knowledge base.

# Prerequisites
- Follow instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/how-to/set-up-qnamaker-service-azure)
to create a QnA Maker service.
- Follow instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/quickstarts/create-publish-knowledge-base) to
import and publish your newly created QnA Maker service.
- Update [appsettings.json](appsettings.json) with your kbid (KnowledgeBase Id), endpointKey and endpointHost. QnA knowledge base setup and application configuration steps can be found [here](https://aka.ms/qna-instructions).
- (Optional) Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-tools/tree/master/packages/QnAMaker) to set up the
QnA Maker CLI to deploy the model.

## To try this sample

- Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```

- In a terminal, navigate to `samples/csharp_dotnetcore/48.qnamaker-active-learning-bot`
- Run the bot from a terminal or from Visual Studio, choose option A or B.

  A) From a terminal

  ```bash
  # run the bot
  dotnet run
  ```

  B) Or from Visual Studio

  - Launch Visual Studio
  - File -> Open -> Project/Solution
  - Navigate to `samples/csharp_dotnetcore/48.qnamaker-active-learning-bot` folder
  - Select `QnAMakerActiveLearningBot.csproj` file
  - Press `F5` to run the project

## Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

[Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator version 4.3.0 or greater from [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/BotFramework-Emulator/releases)

### Connect to the bot using Bot Framework Emulator

- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot
- Enter a Bot URL of `http://localhost:3978/api/messages`

# Try Active Learning
- Once your QnA Maker service is up and you have published the sample KB, try the following queries to trigger the Train API on the bot.
- Sample queries: "surface pro 4", "apps on your surface pro"

# Deploy the bot to Azure
See [Deploy your C# bot to Azure][50] for instructions.

The deployment process assumes you have an account on Microsoft Azure and are able to log into the [Microsoft Azure Portal][60].

If you are new to Microsoft Azure, please refer to [Getting started with Azure][70] for guidance on how to get started on Azure.
