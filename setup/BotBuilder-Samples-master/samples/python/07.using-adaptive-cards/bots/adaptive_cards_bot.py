    This bot will respond to the user's input with an Adaptive Card. Adaptive Cards are a way for developers to
    exchange card content in a common and consistent way. A simple open card format enables an ecosystem of shared
    tooling, seamless integration between apps, and native cross-platform performance on any device. For each user
    interaction, an instance of this class is created and the OnTurnAsync method is called.  This is a Transient
    lifetime service. Transient lifetime services are created each time they're requested. For each Activity
    received, a new instance of this class is created. Objects that are expensive to construct, or have a lifetime
    beyond the single turn, should be carefully managed.
