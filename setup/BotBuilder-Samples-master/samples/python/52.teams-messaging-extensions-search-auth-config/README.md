# Teams Search Auth Config

[Messaging Extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/what-are-messaging-extensions) are a special kind of Microsoft Teams application that is support by the [Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com) v4.

There are two basic types of Messaging Extension in Teams: [Search-based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command) and [Action-based](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command). This sample is built on sample 50.teams-messaging-extension-search, and illustrates how to build a Search-based Messaging Extension with a configuration page, as well as how to sign in from a search Messaging Extension.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account
- [Python SDK](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version 3.7
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or equivalent tunnelling solution

## To try this sample

> Note these instructions are for running the sample on your local machine, the tunnelling solution is required because
the Teams service needs to call into the bot.

1) Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```

1) Run ngrok - point to port 3978

    ```bash
    ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
    ```

1) Create [Bot Framework registration resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-registration) in Azure
    - Use the current `https` URL you were given by running ngrok. Append with the path `/api/messages` used by this sample
    - Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
    - __*If you don't have an Azure account*__ you can use this [Bot Framework registration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/bots/how-to/create-a-bot-for-teams#register-your-web-service-with-the-bot-framework)
    - Add an AAD OAuth Connection Setting to the bot. [Add authentication to your bot](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-authentication)  The name of this connection setting will be added to config.py as CONNECTION_NAME.

1) In a terminal, go to `samples\python\52.teams-messaging-extensions-search-auth-config`

1) Update the `config.py` configuration for the bot to use the Microsoft App Id and App Password from the Bot Framework registration. (Note the App Password is referred to as the "client secret" in the azure portal and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)  Also add the OAuth Connection Setting name to config.py as CONNECTION_NAME and the ngrok endpoint url as SITE_URL.

1) __*This step is specific to Teams.*__
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `teamsAppManifest` folder to replace your Microsoft App Id (that was created when you registered your bot earlier) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `<<YOUR-MICROSOFT-APP-ID>>` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Zip** up the contents of the `teamsAppManifest` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - **Upload** the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the Apps view click "Upload a custom app")

1) Activate your desired virtual environment
1) Install dependencies by running ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` in the project folder.
1) Run your bot, either from Visual Studio or terminal with `python app.py`.

## Interacting with the bot in Teams

> Note this `manifest.json` specified that the feature will be available from both the `compose`, `message` and `commandBox` areas of Teams. Please refer to Teams documentation for more details.

Once the Messaging Extension is installed, click the icon for **Config Auth Search** in the Compose Box's Messaging Extension menu to display the search window.  Right click to choose **Settings** and view the Config page.  The default search is Pypi, and can be changed to Email from the Config page.


## Deploy the bot to Azure
